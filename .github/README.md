[![Build Status](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-non-blizzlike-fixes/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-non-blizzlike-fixes)

This module aims to correct some Blizzlike issues that the community, because they worked that way in the official version, will not add these changes to the emulator. The idea is to correct the behavior of certain content that, despite being poorly designed or having flaws, is considered official and should not be on the server.
